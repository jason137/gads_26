1) Define the following terms:
- tsv
- feature
- header row
- record
- delimiter

2) Identify the function of each of these Unix programs. What are some

- `cat`
- `uniq`
- `head`
- `sort`
- `wc`

3) How can you access the system's built-in documentation for Unix programs?

4) Describe the use of the Unix pipe. Why would you want to use this?

5) Why is it important to ensure that a dataset is properly formatted?

6) T or F: input to `uniq` should be sorted for best results.

7) How many records are in `datasets/citibike.csv`? How many features? Write Unix
commands to find these numbers.

8) Create a sorted frequency distribution of the sizes of files & directories in your home
directory using the `du` program. You will probably want to use a flag to keep
the depth manageable.  

9) Create the output from #7 in human-readable format. How might this affect the sorting?

10) What technical difficulties might you face working with `datasets/gdp.csv`?
Write a Unix command that demonstrates this.
