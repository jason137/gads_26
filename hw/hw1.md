# HW # 1 
## Due: Oct 5th   
   
   
Finish answering the computer exericies from lecture 2   

Copy your ans + terminal output and align it 4 spaces from the left. See the first question as an example. Once complete send us a text file via email  to `zunayed@gmail.com` AND `arisha84@gmail.com`  with the subject `[gads-26][hw1] Fullname`
### Ex1

7) How many records are in datasets/citibike.csv? How many features? Write Unix commands to find these numbers


    Î» zunayed-terminal > cat datasets/blah.tsv | blah -f1 | blah | blah -c 

       1 Borough
     XXX Staten Island
     XXX Manhattan
     XXX Bronx
     XXX Queens
     XXX Brooklyn
 

8) Create a sorted frequency distribution of the sizes of files & directories in your home directory using the du program. You will probably want to use a flag to keep the depth manageable.

9) Re-create the output from #7 in human-readable format. How might this affect the sorting?

10) What technical difficulties might you face working with datasets/gdp.csv? Write a Unix command that demonstrates this.


### Ex2

9) Create a frequency distribution of the areas of parks in Brooklyn using the datasets/nyc_parks.tsv file. How would you characterize the shape of this distribution? What steps could you take to improve its usefulness?

10) Print the 5th line of datasets/snowfall.tsv. Now try to do it another way (don't use grep for either).

11) How many lines are in datasets/Capablanca.pgn? How many records?

12) The pgn files in the datasets directory contain data in a format that's common for storing the results of chess games. Create (separate) frequency distributions for the first moves of each game in each of these these files. What can you conclude from your results?
