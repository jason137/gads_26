1) Select a dataset that interests you and formulate a problem that can
be addressed with classification. What question are you trying to answer? Try
to be as specific as you can.

2) Perform cross-validated classification on your dataset using at least three
different techniques (including ensemble methods). What can you conclude from
your results?

3) Try to apply some hyperparameter tuning (using cross-validation or a
manual ad-hoc method). How do your results differ from before?

4) If you were to continue investigating this question with additional data,
what data would you seek out? Why? How would this affect your analysis?
