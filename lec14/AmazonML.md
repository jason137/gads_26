## AWS
Amazon Web Services (AWS) allows you to easily launch computing resources in the cloud. 
It provides many services to handle storage (EBS or S3) and computing (EC2 or EMR). 
With Ec2 we can launch virtual machines that will run in data center. These will generally be more powerful
machines than our local computers and we can launch one large machine or many machines in a cluster 
(machines that do distributed computing leveraging a framework like Hadoop or Spark). 
AWS also overs a simpler UI to write MapReduce code for Hadoop through their EMR offering. 
This allows you to not have to maintain a cluster, but just submit a task to an existing cluster.

## Amazon Machine Learning

Amazon Machine Learning makes it easy for developers of all skill levels to use machine learning (ML) technology.
Amazon Machine Learning is a managed service for building ML models and generating predictions that enable
the development of robust, scalable smart applications.

## Cloud computing service models - IaaS, PaaS, SaaS

### IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
As the name suggests, provides you the computing infrastructure,
physical or (quite often) virtual machines and other resources like virtual-machine disk image library,
block and file-based storage, firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses, virtual local area networks etc. 
Examples: Amazon EC2, Windows Azure, Rackspace, Google Compute Engine.

### PaaS (Platform as a Service)
As the name suggests, provides you computing platforms which typically includes operating system,
programming language execution environment, database, web server etc. Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk,
Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com, Google App Engine, Apache Stratos.

### SaaS (Software as a Service) 
This model you are provided with access to application softwares often referred to as on-demand softwares.
You don't have to worry about the installation, setup and running of the application. 
Service provider will do that for you. You just have to pay and use it through some client.
Examples: Google Apps, Microsoft Office 365.
