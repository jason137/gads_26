# welcome to data science at GA!

You're seeing this file here because it's the README for the base directory of this
[repo](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1).
We'll use it to keep track of useful links and information.

## datasets  
There are a handful of (small) datasets in this repo that you can use to
practice the techniques we discuss in class. Don't hesitate to seek out & use
other datasets that you find interesting! We can even post them here to share.
