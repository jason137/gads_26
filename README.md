# welcome to data science at GA!

You're seeing this file here because it's the README for the base directory of this
[repo](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1).
We'll use it to keep track of useful links and information.

## datasets  
There are a handful of (small) datasets in this repo that you can use to
practice the techniques we discuss in class. Don't hesitate to seek out & use
other datasets that you find interesting! We can even post them here to share.

## anaconda installation  
https://github.com/jason137/gads_26/blob/master/anaconda.md

## general data science references  
https://github.com/jason137/gads_26/blob/master/general_references.md

## syllabus  
lec 1 - intro & setup  
lec 2 - data exploration & pre-processing with Unix  
lec 3 - data manipulation with pandas  

## TODO
- histo: add 5-num summary, range, iqr, scale for large N
- more unix: avg, pctile, ecdf

exploratory data analysis
- unix: iqr, histo, pctile, ecdf
- viz: scatterplots, trends (smoothing), boxplots, bar charts, seasonality
